        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jeffrey Gao and I am a first year student at University of California-Riverside. Prior to being a student at UCR, I worked as a summer camp leader for elementary school children when I was in my sophomore year of high school. I worked with a group of high school students to help give these kids the best summer experience we could. We planned overnight trips to the woods, went to parks and tourist destinations to show them around San Francisco, and had free time to just play games and bond. By far the most fun part of the experience was creating a play with the campers for the whole Cameron House organization and their parents. Just seeing the joy in their faces when we took their ideas seriously in creating the play to them actually performing is something I will never forget. I also had an internship at StitchFix where I worked under the product management team. I collected data and researched competitors to see what makes their brand and website attractive to their customers to see if we could incorporate anything similar to our website. It was also a career building sort of thing for high school students, so we also worked on our resumes and interview skills. I was also placed with other interns at the same company so that we could build teamwork skills. I learned a lot about how a company analyzes customer data and how the flow of manufacturing products to getting them to customers work and it was a big eye-opener for me as to why things cost the way they cost. Lastly, I worked for the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management. I went on trips around San Francisco to all the different parts of the SFDEM and saw how they all worked in tandem. I also worked on projects such as seeing how the creation of the Chase Center would affect the time it would take for ambulances to get to their hospitals due to the increase of traffic during events held at the Chase Center. This time, I had a big group of interns who worked all together on the big projects and I had a lot of fun with it. We did not know what to do at first, but with proper guidance and us becoming closer as friends really made it easy to work with each other and I definitely feel like I have gained valuable communication and teamwork skills from that experience alone. I also became good friends with a couple of my bosses and we still communicate to this day. One of them was the reason for me joining a fraternity because he told me about all his great times when he was president and how much he grew as a man really intrigued me. Aside from that, I really enjoy going to the gym and watching/playing basketball, but my favorite thing by far is just being around great friends and just having a good time. My friends have had the biggest influence on me and were the ones who pushed me to better myself by getting the jobs that I got.  <br><br>
